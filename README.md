# Module 18: NoSQL Assignment

## Social Media Network API

## Description
The driving force behind this application was to develop and build a API to interact with a social media network where 'Users' can interact and befriend other users as well as exchange thoughts and reactions.
This application was built primarily by using Express.js for routing of the API, MongoDB for the database structure, Mongoose ODM, and Moment.js for the timing variables.

## Usage
To begin using the application you will need to initialize it by first invoking the run command from your terminal.

```
npm start

Afterwards use whichever software service you would prefer to check the API out. This application was built utilizing Insomnia so that is what I will recommend.

Follow this up by inspecting the application's files, specifically the controllers and routes to understand how the application is behaving.
